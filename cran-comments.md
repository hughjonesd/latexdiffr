First release. This package requires the latexdiff utility, which
I assume is not available on CRAN. So, most tests are turned off.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.0.5
* github actions
* win-devel via the web interface

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is a new release.

\description{
\code{git_latexdiff()} checks out a previous version of a file and calls latexdiff
on it.
}
\details{
\code{git_latexdiff} only checks out the specific file in \code{path}. If your Rmd file depends on external
resources which have also changed, you will need to checkout the old revision as a whole and
create the tex file manually.

\examples{
\dontrun{
git_latexdiff("file1.Rmd", "HEAD^")
